							&nbsp;&nbsp; For auction is Panzer Dragoon Saga for the Sega Saturn system.&nbsp; The game is complete with the four game discs, case, and instruction booklet.<br><br>&nbsp; The discs have some light scratches but the game has been played the entire way through and it plays flawlessly.&nbsp; The case and booklet are in nice shape.<br><br>&nbsp; This auction is for the U.S.A. and Canada only.<br><br><u>&nbsp;<b> Buyers from the U.S.A., please take note:</b></u>&nbsp; Going by other auctions on eBay, the final value for this game will be at least $300.&nbsp; I will be shipping this game from Canada, so I will have to declare the 
full value of the auction on the customs declaration for insurance 
purposes.&nbsp; I'm not sure of the exact rules regarding importing items from Canada to the U.S.A., but I'm pretty sure that U.S. buyers will have to pay customs duty and possibly taxes on the final value of the game because it will be over $200.&nbsp; So, buyers from the U.S.A. please be aware that most likely you will have to pay duty and be sure to find out the exact rules for your area.<br><br>&nbsp; Shipping for the game will be $20, whether you live in the U.S.A. or Canada. (this includes insurance for the game).<br><br>&nbsp; Please feel free to e-mail any questions. </div>
