You are bidding on a game called &nbsp;<strong>Albert Odyssey</strong>&nbsp;for the Sega Saturn. Don't miss out on a GREAT game! Our feedback speaks for itself, Sashimi Games offers authentic products and fast and friendly service. ACTUAL item is pictured below, we don't use stock photos! Includes the original longbox case and manual, manual is missing the registration card. Disc has a very few light scratches which do not affect play. We are experienced shippers and package ALL these fragile longbox packaged games in a sturdy outer cardboard box with padding inside for maximum protection!</p>
<p>
Shipping rates are quoted at the bottom of this listing, I do combine shipping on multiple games and offer very fair rates. We accept PayPal only.

<font color="red"><b>ALL INTERNATIONAL BUYERS:</b> As of January 27th, 2013 the US Postal Service (USPS) is drastically increasing their rates for international shipping, in some cases by as much as 100%. I do not like this and apologize for the increase, but I have to raise my rates accordingly. I just want you to know that I am not gouging you on the shipping cost, the price you see quoted is what I have to pay USPS to ship your package.</font><p><b>ALSO ALL INTERNATIONAL BUYERS:</b>
Unless otherwise noted, all games are for the USA region in NTSC format, please be sure your system is capable of playing these games. I am not responsible for determining this, YOU ARE. If you have a question about this, ask me BEFORE you buy.
</p><p>
<b>Buyers in CANADA, EUROPE, and AUSTRALIA:</b>
Shipping times to Canada, Europe, and Australia take anywhere from 10-31 days. MOST of the time, it's on the low end of that range, but please understand it does occasionally take longer.
