You are bidding on a game called &nbsp;<strong>Megaman X4</strong>&nbsp;for the Sega Saturn.  Don't miss out on a GREAT game! Our feedback speaks for itself, Sashimi Games offers authentic products and fast and friendly service.  ACTUAL item is pictured below, we don't use stock photos! Includes the original longbox case with artwork and manual, case has a small one-inch crack on the back.  Disc has a few light scratches which do not affect play. We are experienced shippers and package ALL these fragile longbox packaged games in a sturdy outer cardboard box with padding inside for maximum protection!</p>

Shipping rates are quoted at the bottom of this listing, I do combine shipping on multiple games and offer very fair rates. We accept PayPal only.

<font color="red"><b>ALL INTERNATIONAL BUYERS:</b> As of January 27th, 2013 the US Postal Service (USPS) is drastically increasing their rates for international shipping, in some cases by as much as 100%.  I do not like this and apologize for the increase, but I have to raise my rates accordingly.  I just want you to know that I am not gouging you on the shipping cost, the price you see quoted is what I have to pay USPS to ship your package.</font><p><b>ALSO ALL INTERNATIONAL BUYERS:</b>
Unless otherwise noted, all games are for the USA region in NTSC format, please be sure your system is capable of playing these games.  I am not responsible for determining this, YOU ARE.  If you have a question about this, ask me BEFORE you buy.
</p><p>
<b>Buyers in CANADA, EUROPE, and AUSTRALIA:</b>
Shipping times to Canada, Europe, and Australia take anywhere from 10-31 days.  MOST of the time, it's on the low end of that range, but please understand it does occasionally take longer.
</p><p>
<b>Buyers in BRAZIL, ARGENTINA, and other parts of SOUTH AMERICA:</b>
I love that I have so many buyers from this region and am happy to serve you.  Before you buy, understand that it can take anywhere from 17-45+ days to reach South America.  This is not my fault, the local postal services in South America are moving extremely slowly right now.  If you are not comfortable with this and are not willing to wait the alloted time, please do not buy.  <font color="red"><b>Additionally, all packages to Brazil, Argentina, and South America will have a handling fee of $2 per package.  Insurance is included in this handling fee.</b></font>  This is the only way I can continue to service this part of the world, I have had too many lost packages there.
</p><p>
Eu tenho muitos clientes nesse país e é um prazer vender meus produtos a vocês, fico muito feliz em servi-los. Antes de comprar, entenda que o prazo de envio varia de 17 a 45 dias, talvez mais. Isso não é minha culpa, é causado pela alfândega e pelos correios brasileiros que são extremamente lentos. <font color="red"><b>Além disso, todos os compradores brasileiros devem acrescentar $2 (dólares) a mais no valor do envio para que o pacote seja enviado com seguro.</b></font> Esse é o único jeito de continuar vendendo jogos para essa região do mundo, pois já tive muitos pacotes extraviados/perdidos. Se você não concorda com isso e não deseja esperar, por favor não compre.
</p><p>
<b>Buyers in MEXICO, ITALY, and SPAIN:</b>
<font color="red"><b>All packages to Mexico, Italy, and Spain will have a handling fee of $2 per package.  Insurance is included in this handling fee.</b></font>  This is the only way I can continue to service these parts of the world, I have had too many lost packages there.
