toward your village for revenge.<br><br>panzer dragoon ii zwei is a prequel as it takes place before panzer dragoon. similar to the first game, you ride on the back of a dragon who has two types of attacks. players can also still turn the dragon as they fire upon enemies. a new feature is a beserker button that can be used when a meter bar is full. when used, the dragon will fire a number of laser blasts that automatically find their target. another new option is the ability to select your path. panzer dragoon ii zwei runs on rails so you do not have complete freedom, just alternate paths
